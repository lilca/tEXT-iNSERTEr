What's tEXT-iNSERTEr
===

tEXT-iNSERTEr is the tools for inserting reference file as text data to the appointed place in text file.  
tEXT-iNSERTEr was designed with strong focus on following:
  1. To work at various text file format
  2. To cover nesting structure of reference file
  3. Not to require regular expression  
I developed `tir` and `tirc` to achieve above focus on OS X.  
`tir` is a tool written in C for inserting the text data of reference file into the specified place of a input file.  
`tirc` is a tool written in shell script for building Makefile of specified tir-file with using `tir`.
